# Java Max Number Finder

This Java program (`Cond.java`) efficiently determines the maximum number among three integers using conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`). 
It demonstrates effective decision-making logic and provides insights into handling multiple conditions in Java.

## Description

The program compares three integer variables (`x`, `y`, `z`) to identify the largest among them. 
It utilizes conditional statements to execute different actions based on the comparison results. Through clear and concise code, it offers a valuable learning experience in Java programming.

## Usage

To run the program:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `Cond.java` file.
4. Compile the Java file using the following command:
5. Run the compiled Java program using the command:
6. The program will display the maximum number among the provided integers.
